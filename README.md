# Movie app
Assignment to make a server side app with certain performance techniques and a service worker. I used the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">"https://www.themoviedb.org/"</a> API to fetch the movies.

## Performance



## Build

The current `.env` is hidden from GitHub. Make sure you add an `.env` file with the following API key:  
`API_KEY={yourAPIKEYhere}`.

To use the app run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the server on port `9000`.
